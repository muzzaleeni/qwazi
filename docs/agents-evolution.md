# Agent Evolution Notes (Repo)

Purpose: record durable learnings that changed repo operation (commands, conventions, guardrails).
Not a diary.

## When to write an entry
Only when:
- Local `AGENTS.md` changes, OR
- A recurring friction leads to a new operational rule.

Do NOT log:
- One-off fixes
- Temporary context
- Cosmetic edits
- Routine work

## Entry format
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>
**Change:** <1–2 lines>  
**Why:** <1–2 lines>  
**Signal:** <what triggered it>  

## Maintenance
- Keep entries concise.
- If learnings become stable, ensure they are reflected in `AGENTS.md`.
- If the file grows large, summarize older entries instead of letting it expand indefinitely.

### 2026-02-23 — Initial repo bootstrap notes
**Change:** Created local `AGENTS.md` with repo-specific run/test/typecheck commands, structure, env vars, gotchas, and definition of done. Added this evolution log file.  
**Why:** Global bootstrap requires local operational notes so agent actions are grounded in current repo reality.  
**Signal:** `AGENTS.md` and `docs/agents-evolution.md` were missing in repository root/docs.
